## cl-automaton

A Common Lisp DFA/NFA (finite-state automata) implementation with
Unicode alphabet and support for the standard regular expression
operations (concatenation, union, Kleene star) and a number of
non-standard ones (intersection, complement, etc.), derived from
[Automaton](http://www.brics.dk/automaton/).
